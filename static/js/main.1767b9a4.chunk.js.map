The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor (&Aacute;lvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman, Tokyo (&Uacute;rsula Corber&oacute;), and having a strong Spanish identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.</p>\n            <p>The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. Netflix acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money Heist: The Phenomenon (Spanish: La casa de papel: El Fen&oacute;meno). In July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part, which will be released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December 2021, respectively. The series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 and 4 were also filmed in Panama, Thailand and Italy (Florence).</p>\n            <p>The series received several awards including Best Drama Series at the 46th International Emmy Awards, as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song &quot;Bella ciao,&quot; which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English-language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,[4] with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin American world.</p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\nexport default About;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from \"@fortawesome/react-fontawesome\";\r\nimport {\r\n    faFacebook,\r\n    faTwitter,\r\n    faInstagram\r\n  } from \"@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons\";\r\n\r\nexport default function SocialFollow() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div class=\"social-container\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KSathvi\" className=\"twitter social\">\r\n        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTwitter} size=\"3x\" />\r\n        </a>\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sathvik_korrapati\"className=\"instagram social\">\r\n        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faInstagram} size=\"3x\" />\r\n    </a>\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/saisathvik.k.1\"className=\"facebook social\">\r\n        <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFacebook} size=\"3x\" />\r\n    </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport SocialFollow from \"./SocialFollow\"\n\nfunction Contact(){\n    return(\n        <div>\n            <h4>NAME: K SAI SATHVIK</h4>\n            <h4>ID: 20181CSE0300</h4>\n            <h4>SECTION: 6CSE5</h4>\n            <SocialFollow />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\nexport default Contact;","import React from 'react';\n\n\nfunction Home(props){\n    return(\n        <div>\n            <h5>Money Heist</h5>\n            <img src=\"\\Sathvik.jpg\" alt = \"Error\" width=\"970\" height=\"545\"></img>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\nexport default Home;","import './App.css';\nimport Nav from './Nav';\nimport About from './About';\nimport Contact from './Contact';\nimport Home from './Home';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router,Route,Switch} from 'react-router-dom';\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Nav/>\n      <Switch>\n      <Route path='/home' component={Home}/> \n      <Route path='/about' component={About}/>\n      <Route path='/contact' component={Contact}/>\n      </Switch>\n    </div>\n    </Router>\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\nreportWebVitals();\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
